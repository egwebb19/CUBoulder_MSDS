The platform formerly known as Twitter (#foreverInOurHearts) is an important tool in the digital age not only for sharing every single thought we have, but for communicating crucial messages in real time. Because of peoples' tendency to report disasters on Twitter rather than to 911, more agencies are interested in monitoring it to learn of disasters before they're called in.

However, most agencies do not have the manpower to actively scroll Twitter all day looking for people in desperate situations (though I'm sure most working professional do a little of this during office hours anyway), so they'd like to employ computers instead. The problem with most computers is they generally can't tell the difference between "These dance moves are fire!" and "My house is on fire!"

This is where Natural Language Processing (NLP) comes in. The purpose of this project is to apply NLP to 10,000 hand-classified tweets, which have been labeled as a real disaster (1) or not (0).

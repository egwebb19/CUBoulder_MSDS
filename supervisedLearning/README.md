The purpose of this project is to analyze data about Titanic passengers and predict whether they survived the disaster using supervised machine learning models. 
We begin with some data cleaning and exploratory analysis to understand some of the features of our dataset and their relationship to each other and to the passengers' survival. From there, I attempt two ordinary least squares linear classifiers, just to see how well they will fit the data. These have the added benefit of further depicting the relationship between some features and the predicted variable. Finally, I construct a Random Forest Classifier and then tune it to achieve a final test accuracy of 85%.

**Strategy**

1. Analyze & preprocess data: perform EDA, fill in missing values, and scale data for KMeans clustering algorithm.
2. Build/train KMeans clustering algorithm: determine best value of using elbow plot, tune other model hyperparameters.
3. Build/train the final model. Investigate data as it is clustered.
4. Discussion & Conclusion.
